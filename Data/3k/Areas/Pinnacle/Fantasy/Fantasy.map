A little more than a century ago, travelers of all professions came to this library to indulge in its wealth of books, tomes, journals, and other sources of information. There are fifteen stone columns across each end of the library to support the roof. Between the tops of the columns are entablatures that contain wood carvings of epic battles during the Mage Wars. Behind the columns is a stone cobbled wall where you can see a door that leads into the library. There appear to be no windows that adorn the walls on this level of the library. The library has always been known to be shrouded in a veil of mystery. Possibly an answer lies within as to what made this mecca of knowledge disappear.
