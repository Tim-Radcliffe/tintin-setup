The southern wall looks climbable. Maybe you should climb back out now.  The floor is vaguely funnel-shaped, leading to a hole in the center which falls to an unknown place.  You can hear strange, guttural noises coming from the hole.  } {} {} {} {} {1.000}

You have very little sense of direction in this distinctly evil realm, where the firmament beneath your feet seems hardly as real as the sights before your eyes.  } {} {} {} {} {1.000}

The walls are made of a somehow soft metal which undulates gently, as though floating upon itself.  There is a small bed of ice against one wall, tiny and wet.

There is even a bed in what might be considered the corner, where some  truly indiscriminate being must rest.  There is an opening in the hovel to the northwest.  } {} {} {} {} {1.000}

The highly-wrought geometric corridor through which you are passing is constructed of an impossibly smooth crystal, translucent to the eye. You can see approximately a foot into the surface, after which point it becomes hopelessly opaque.
