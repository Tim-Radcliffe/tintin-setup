The outer airlock door leads out of the station.  It might lead out into space, or back to the land from whence you came.  Panels on the walls display a dizzying array of blinking lights and incomprehensible controls.  An open airlock door leads into the station.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

The ceiling is hidden above a tangle of ducts, pipes, and conduits.  A large circular door here leads to the main airlock - the way in and out of the station.  Sealed bins along one wall hold weapons and ammunition.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

The volume above the countertop contains an assortment of unfamiliar devices that are probably related to food preparation.  You don't recognize a microwave or refrigerator anywhere, though.  A glass coffee carafe sits on the countertop under a nozzle.  Three small tables line the outer wall, separated by bulkheads.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}
