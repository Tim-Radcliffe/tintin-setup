Your nostrils are assaulted by a sickly sweet odour.  The foul stench is a combination of fruity, melon-smelling air freshener, tainted by an over-powering scent of sweat.  There seems to be a number of people both coming and going through here.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

There is a reception desk here where members can check in, as well as a schedule on the wall.  Beside the schedule, you see what seems to be a map of the facilities (for new members you would assume).} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

Almost all of them seem to be following the lead of one of the perkiest people you have ever seen on the platform to the south.  This must be what they call a 'step class'.

Dark and vile images of medival torture devices flash through your mind as you glance around the room.  You also notice that the overwhelming majority of people here are either nattering old grandmothers who seem to do nothing but sit on the equipment, or loud-mouthed youths with seemingly little regard for anything but annoying everyone else.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

(The 'Canadian' Sports Network).  Arrayed in a multi-row semi-circle in front of the TV's is a hodge-podge of excercise machines. These machines range from your basic stationary bike, to the ever-popular rowing machine, treadmills, step machines, and even some odd contraption from Reebok that forces people to swing their legs in front of them in some sort of moon- walking motion. Scary.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}
