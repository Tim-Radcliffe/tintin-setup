R {    1} {0} {<068>} {Pinnacle Reception Hall} { } {		Pinnacle Reception Hall  You stand in a large reception hall.  A vaulted ceiling rises over your head to a height of nearly twenty feet. White marble is everywhere, the floors, the walls and even the ceiling are constructed from the beautiful stone. The flicker of bright candles illuminates the hall of the Player's Council to the west.  An elegant stairway ascends upwards towards the adventurers guild on the second floor of the building.  A similar staircase descends to the central council chamber and board rooms of the 3 Kingdoms below. A large archway opens to the east, leading out to Pinnacle's main street.  From the north, you hear the lively banter of the Kingdom's Clans and from the south comes the sounds of animated discussion of the players and wizards of 3K.  A bronze plaque has been set into the floor in the center of the room and a huge map of Pinnacle has been engraved on a raised dais nearby. } {} {} {} {} {1.000}

Here, players can read and write on the various boards, giving their opinions about upcoming changes and new ideas. Nearly all of Three Kingdoms most prestigious citizens can be seen here at one time or another.  If you're lucky, you might even get to see one of the high wizards aimlessly roaming the halls (probably looking for the bathroom).  Also, this is where you learn about the different guilds available to the players here at 3 Kingdoms.  A large glass case in the center of the room contains each of the prospective guild objects.  There is a large sign here with arrows pointing in various directions. } {} {} {} {} {1.000}
