A spiral staircase made of some odd metal dominates the center of the Palisade.   The old-style western saloon doors that exit to Pinnacle are to the north.  An open door is to your west and there seems to be some sort of humidor set up in the eastern section. There seems to be another exit from the room to the south, behind the bar.  A menu is posted in neon glory above the bar. } {Mud} {} {} {} {1.000}
