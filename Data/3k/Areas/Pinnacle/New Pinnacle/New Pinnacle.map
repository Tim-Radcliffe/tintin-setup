An iron furnace takes up the center of the room.  Rope strung from its chimney pipe to the walls holds up cloth partitions dividing the house into crude rooms.  Some cots have been set up in the partitioned parts of the house.  A scorched oak desk sits near the door.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}

No bodies, blood, or debris litter the road.  The burnt-out hulks of cottages have been cleared, and two new houses stand nearby.  One looks livable.  The other still lacks doors and part of its roof.  All around, you spot villagers teaming up to plant crops, gather construction materials, or haul water.  The percussive bang of a hammer echoes off a large pile of stones beside you.} {} {} {} {} {1.000}
